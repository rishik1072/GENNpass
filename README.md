Secure Password Generator – Python GUI Application

This project is a desktop-based password generator developed using Python and Tkinter. The application provides a graphical user interface that allows users to generate secure and random passwords based on customizable criteria such as length and character composition.

The program validates user input to ensure minimum password strength, prevents invalid configurations, and uses Python’s random and string libraries to generate cryptographically strong passwords. A clipboard feature is included to allow users to easily copy the generated password for immediate use.
